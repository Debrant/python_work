# python_work
This repo is a collection of the exersises from: "Python Crash Course; A Hand-On Project-Based Introduction to Programming," by Eric Matthes. ISBN 978-1-59327-603-4


I made this repo in preperation for taking on an intern and to familiarize myself with the materials I will use to help train. Since, I work on as many as four different machines, this is easier than working from a thumb drive.

### Deviations from book
You will find a mix of word for word recreation of the book's exersisces side by side with files that only bear a passing resemblance to the original. In these cases, I only sought to fully understand the concept by expanding or extrapolating the code to meet my ends.
